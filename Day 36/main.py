## STEP 1: Use https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#daily
# When stock price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").


# replace the "demo" apikey below with your own key from https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key

r = requests.get(url)
print(f"Sending request to:  {r.url}")

print(
    f"[{yesterday}] Closing Price: {yesterday_close_price}\n[{day_before_yesterday}] Closing Price: {previous_day_close}")

# TODO 1. - Get yesterday's closing stock price. Hint: You can perform list comprehensions on Python dictionaries. e.g. [new_value for (key, value) in dictionary.items()]

# TODO 2. - Get the day before yesterday's closing stock price

# TODO 3. - Find the positive difference between 1 and 2. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20. Hint: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_abs.asp

difference = float(get_previous_day_close_price) - float(get_yesterday_close_price)

# TODO 4. - Work out the percentage difference in price between closing price yesterday and closing price the day before yesterday.

percent_change = (difference / float(get_previous_day_close_price)) * 100

# TODO 5. - If TODO4 percentage is greater than 5 then print("Get News").

if percent_change > 5:
    print('Get News')
else:
    print('Not 5% change')
## STEP 2: https://newsapi.org/
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually get the first 3 news pieces for the COMPANY_NAME.

# TODO 6. - Instead of printing ("Get News"), use the News API to get articles related to the COMPANY_NAME.

# TODO 7. - Use Python slice operator to create a list that contains the first 3 articles. Hint: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-slice-notation


## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# to send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number.

# TODO 8. - Create a new list of the first 3 article's headline and description using list comprehension.

# TODO 9. - Send each article as a separate message via Twilio.


# Optional TODO: Format the message like this:
"""
